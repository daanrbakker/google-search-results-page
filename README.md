This project is an assignment for The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. The assignment was to build the Google search results page.

This project demonstrates some basic HTML/CSS skills I have learned since out with The Odin Project, such as positioning elements and basic styling. It is a little more difficult than the last project (building the Google homepage).
